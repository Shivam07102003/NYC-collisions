Analyze **motor vehicle collisions in New York City** using **data science, statistics, and machine learning**.  
This project explores **borough-level patterns, contributing factors, seasonal effects, and injury correlations** from over **230K+ collision records**.

---

## 📂 Setup Instructions
Clone the repository and set up a virtual environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nyc-collisions.git
cd nyc-collisions
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If no `requirements.txt` is present, install manually:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy scikit-learn jupyter
```

---

## 🔄 How to Use
1. Open the notebook in **Jupyter**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook nyc_collisions.ipynb
   ```
2. Update the dataset path if required (replace the Colab path with local file path).  
3. Run all cells **top to bottom** to reproduce the analysis.

---

## 📊 Dataset
This project uses **one dataset**:
- `dsc project nyc.xlsx` (~238K collision records)

Key fields include:
- **Date, Time, Borough**  
- **Latitude, Longitude**  
- **Contributing Factor, Vehicle Type**  
- **Persons, Pedestrians, Cyclists, and Motorists Injured/Killed**

---

## 📈 Key Results
- 🚗 **Brooklyn & Queens** → highest number of collisions  
- 📱 **Driver inattention/distraction** → most common contributing factor  
- ☀️ **Summer months** → peak collision season  
- 🔗 **Motorist injuries** → strong correlation with overall injuries
